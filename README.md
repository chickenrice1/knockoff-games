## About the Developer
Hey, I'm @chickenrice1, a 'passionate' coder and game developer. I torture myself creating projects that blend fun and learning, and these knockoff games are a testament to that passion. Currently, I'm exploring the world of computer science and engineering, sometimes eager to learn and take on new challenges.
